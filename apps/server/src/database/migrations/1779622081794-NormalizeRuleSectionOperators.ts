/**
 * Backfills the `operator` field of stored rules that were saved without an
 * explicit AND/OR choice (operator === null).
 *
 * The docs state an operator is required from the second rule/section onwards,
 * but the UI never enforced it, so older rules can carry a null operator. The
 * comparator then inferred a value, and because `+null === 0` is true an unset
 * section operator was wrongly treated as AND.
 *
 * To change behaviour as little as possible, this migration writes back the
 * value each rule *already evaluates as today*, so no existing rule changes
 * how it matches:
 *   - first rule of a later section -> "0" (AND)  - the section-combine default
 *   - any other (within-section) rule -> "1" (OR) - the within-section default
 *   - the first rule of a group keeps null; its operator is forced to null at
 *     runtime regardless, so it is left untouched.
 * Making these explicit also stops the engine from re-inferring the value and
 * keeps the UI's "operator is required" guard from flagging existing rules.
 *
 * Rules are ordered by id, which is how they are (re)written on every save and
 * how the comparator iterates them, so the first id seen for a new section is
 * that section's first rule - the same boundary the comparator uses.
 *
 * Operators are written as strings ("0"/"1") to match the values the UI
 * persists; the comparator coerces with `+`, so string and numeric operators
 * are treated identically.
