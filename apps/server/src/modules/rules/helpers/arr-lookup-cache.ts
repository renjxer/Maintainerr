/**
 * Run-scoped dedupe for the *arr identity lookups* that resolve a media item to
 * its Sonarr series / Radarr movie (`getSeriesByTvdbId` / `getMovieByTmdbId`).
 *
 * Those two lookups are deliberately uncached at the API layer: the empty-show
 * cleanup re-reads them straight after a deletion, and a persisted entry would
 * serve pre-deletion state (#2757 / #2891). #2897 de-cached them for that
 * reason - but that also de-cached the rule-evaluation path, where the same
 * series/movie is resolved once per item. On an episode-level rule that means
 * the same series is looked up thousands of times per run.
 *
 * This memo restores that de-duplication WITHOUT reintroducing the bug: the
 * executor creates it for the rule-evaluation loop only and never hands it to
 * the collection-sync / action phase, so it is gone before any deletion runs
 * and the cleanup still reads Sonarr/Radarr fresh.
 *
 * It also memoizes the MetadataService id/candidate resolution that precedes
 * those arr lookups (media-server ids -> validated provider ids). That resolution
 * is identical for an item across every rule condition but otherwise re-runs each
 * time - redundant CPU, response cloning and duplicate logs (#3285). The Radarr,
 * Sonarr and Seerr getters route their resolution through here.
 *
 * The Plex / Jellyfin / Emby getters use it only for the metadata-backed
 * studios property (via MetadataRuleValueService); their other per-item reads
 * are served from their own API-layer caches, and the Tautulli getter does not
 * use it at all. (Seerr's own request lookups are API-cached too - only the
 * id-resolution that feeds them is deduped here.)
