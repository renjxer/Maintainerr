 * recognized sidecar may be removed; anything else - a media file, an unknown
 * extension, a live symlink, a socket - keeps the whole folder. (A dangling
 * symlink is removed regardless of extension: its target is already gone, so
 * there is nothing left to protect.) A missing entry here therefore only ever
 * leaves a folder uncleaned, never deletes real data. Matched on the
 * lower-cased extension.
 *
 * Kept deliberately narrow: generic extensions (txt, log, md, ...) carry no
 * *arr-sidecar signal and would only widen the blast radius.
