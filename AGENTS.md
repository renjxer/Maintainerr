# Maintainerr - Custom Copilot Instructions

## Important: Workspace Commands

**When running yarn commands (build, test, etc.), always execute from the workspace root:**

```bash
cd /workspace  <--- ensure you are in the root workspace (inside the devbox container)
yarn build | tail -20
yarn test | tail -20
```

**Do NOT run from subdirectories** unless specifically needed for package-specific commands.

## Project Overview

Maintainerr is a media management application that helps users automatically manage their media libraries by creating rules to handle unused or unwatched content. It integrates with Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, \*arr applications (Radarr/Sonarr), Seerr, Tautulli, and Streamystats (Jellyfin only) to provide comprehensive media lifecycle management.

For the broader system architecture map, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Documentation map

**Standing rules - read before writing any code (they apply to all work):**

- [implementation.instructions.md](.github/instructions/implementation.instructions.md) - implementation rules and API-doc references.
- [project-notes.instructions.md](.github/instructions/project-notes.instructions.md) - non-obvious project knowledge, conventions, and gotchas (rule engine, Tailwind v4, migrations, naming) that isn't derivable from the code or git history.

**Task-specific - read only when the task calls for it (don't load them every session):**

- [i18n.instructions.md](.github/instructions/i18n.instructions.md) - when adding or changing any user-facing text in the UI: which macro to use, what must never be translated, and the ICU quoting trap.
- [release-review.instructions.md](.github/instructions/release-review.instructions.md) - when auditing a release candidate before tagging.
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) - before changing cross-module boundaries.

When you add a doc, list it under the matching heading here. For how each agent
(Claude, Copilot, Cursor, Codex) loads these docs, see [README_AGENTS.md](README_AGENTS.md).

## Development Environment

The development environment runs inside **`devbox`** - a rootless Docker container
managed by `~/infra/compose.yml` on the host. This IS the devcontainer for this project.

- `devbox` mounts the repo at `/workspace` and has Node 26 + Yarn 4.11 pre-installed.
  Work directly inside the container at `/workspace` - open your editor/agent here,
  run all `yarn` commands here. Node is only installed in the container, not the host.
- Git works normally from `/workspace`: `git commit` and `git push` directly. The
  SSH key for GitHub is mounted into the container, so no host-side push relay is
  needed.
- Agent state (Claude, Copilot, VS Code server/extensions, SSH, Git config) is mounted
  into `/root` from the host, so it persists across container restarts and recreates.
  Leave those mounts as configured.
- `~/infra/compose.yml` (which defines `devbox`) is live server config on the host,
  outside this git repo. Treat it as operational state, not project code.
- `yarn dev` serves UI on port 3000 and API on port 6246. Logs at `/tmp/yarn-dev.log`.

**Dev media servers** (Plex, Jellyfin, Emby) run as separate rootless Docker containers
in `~/dev-media.compose.yml`, reachable from inside `devbox` by hostname:
- Plex → `http://dev-plex:32400`
- Jellyfin → `http://dev-jellyfin:8096`
- Emby → `http://dev-emby:8096`

Credentials are in `~/dev-media-creds.env` (not committed). Media lives on `/mnt/dev-media`.

### Security model - you are L3, the confined devbox

Three trust levels, privilege descending: **`root`@host** (everything) › **`maintainerr-dev`**
(the SSH host - runs the dev media stack, holds its secrets, controls the devbox) ›
**`devbox`** (you: dev/test only). You can reach the media/service stack by hostname
(`dev-plex`, `dev-radarr`, …) to test and seed against it, but you **cannot break out** to
the host - and that boundary is enforced from above you, so you can't disable it:

- **Read-only Docker** - the socket-proxy allows `ps`/`logs`, never `start`/`stop`/`exec`/`create`.
- **Host egress firewall** - outbound is default-deny to an allowlist (GitHub, npm, Anthropic,
  Plex/TMDB) plus the internal docker network; `NET_ADMIN` is stripped from the container.
- **Rootless + `cap_drop: ALL` + `no-new-privileges`** - even container-root is an unprivileged
  subuid, never the host user.

Don't fight these (e.g. trying to `exec` into another container, or reaching a non-allowlisted
host) - they're intentional, not bugs. Operator-side detail lives in `~/infra/README.md`.

## Development Workflow

### Key Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Development (all packages)
yarn dev

# Build entire project
yarn build

# Lint all packages
yarn lint

# Format code
yarn format

# Run tests
yarn test

# Type checking
yarn check-types
```

> **`yarn test` / `yarn lint` fails with `command not found: <tool>` (exit 127)?**
> Almost always a stale `node_modules` out of sync with `yarn.lock` - yarn can't
> resolve the binary (commonly `vitest`, which is the one test binary not hoisted
> to the root `node_modules/.bin`). Run `yarn install` to resync, then retry. It
> is **not** a PATH or workspace-config problem, so don't reach for explicit
> `./node_modules/.bin/...` paths - fix the install instead.

### CI Workflow Commands

GitHub quality workflows include a separate YAML lint job:

```bash
yamllint -s .
```

The formatting, TypeScript lint, and test workflows use Node.js 24, then run:

```bash
corepack install
corepack enable
yarn --immutable
yarn format:check
yarn lint
yarn turbo build --filter="./packages/*"
yarn turbo test
```

The development Docker workflow builds the multi-stage `Dockerfile` for
`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

The built Docker image includes `/opt/app/healthcheck.sh` as its
`HEALTHCHECK`. It probes `/api/health/ready` on `UI_PORT` and preserves
`BASE_PATH`; use `/api/health/live` for process-only liveness checks and
`/api/health/ready` for database readiness checks.

### Workspace MCP Servers

Project MCP server config lives in `.codex/config.toml` for Codex, `.mcp.json`
for Claude Code, and `.vscode/mcp.json` for VS Code. Keep all three files in
sync when adding or changing servers. The configured GitHub MCP server is
read-only, and Playwright MCP screenshots should be written under
`.playwright-mcp/`.

### Package-Specific Commands

```bash
# Server development
yarn workspace @maintainerr/server dev

# UI development
yarn workspace @maintainerr/ui dev

# Contracts build (required by server/ui)
yarn workspace @maintainerr/contracts build
```

## Coding Standards

### Code Style

- **ESLint**: Strict TypeScript rules across all packages
- **Prettier**: Consistent formatting (run `yarn format`)
- **Commits**: Follow [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) specification. Commit types map to releases via semantic-release:
  - `feat:` → minor release
  - `fix:`, `perf:` → patch release
  - `refactor:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `test:` → no release
  - `BREAKING CHANGE` footer or `!` (e.g. `feat!:`) → major release
- **Import Organization**: Prefer absolute imports, group by type (external, internal, relative)
- **String Handling**: Avoid regex for simple prefix/suffix/substring checks or single-character trimming. Prefer string primitives such as `endsWith`, `startsWith`, `slice`, `substring`, or direct character inspection to reduce unnecessary regex risk; see [OWASP ReDoS guidance](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS). Example: `fix: avoid regex backtracking in disk path normalization (#2526)`.
- **Punctuation**: Never use em or en dashes in any committed artifact (code, comments, log/UI strings, tests, commit messages, docs). Always type a plain ASCII hyphen `-` (U+002D), never `—` (U+2014) or `–` (U+2013). See the convention in [project-notes.instructions.md](.github/instructions/project-notes.instructions.md).

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use strict type checking
- Prefer `interface` for object shapes, `type` for unions/computed types
- Use Zod schemas for runtime validation (especially in contracts package)
- Leverage Nest.js decorators for API documentation and validation

### Architecture Patterns

#### Backend Patterns

- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests, delegate to services
- **Services**: Business logic, integrate with external APIs
- **DTOs**: Use Zod schemas from contracts package
- **Entities**: TypeORM entities for database models
- **Modules**: Feature-based module organization
- **Events**: Use Nest.js EventEmitter for decoupled communication

#### Frontend Patterns

- **Routing**: React Router with `createBrowserRouter` for declarative routing
- **Routes**: Explicit route configuration in `/src/router.tsx` with nested route support
- **Lazy Loading**: Prefer route-level lazy loading for non-shell pages and lazy-load heavy optional UI dependencies such as Monaco-backed editors or markdown renderers behind shared loading boundaries
- **Components**: Reusable UI components in `/src/components`
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks for data fetching (TanStack Query) and navigation (useNavigate, useLocation)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod resolvers
- **API**: Axios client with TypeScript contracts
- **Page Metadata**: React Helmet Async for managing `<head>` elements declaratively
- **Code Splitting**: React.lazy with Suspense for dynamic imports

#### Shared Contracts

- **DTOs**: Request/response shapes with validation
- **Events**: Type-safe event definitions
- **Enums**: Shared constants and enumerations

## File Organization

### Server Structure

```
apps/server/src/
├── modules/        # Feature modules (collections, rules, settings, etc.)
├── common/         # Shared utilities, decorators, filters
├── database/       # TypeORM entities and migrations
├── events/         # Event definitions and handlers
└── main.ts         # Application bootstrap
```

### UI Structure

```
apps/ui/src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks
├── pages/          # Page components for routes (DocsPage, PlexLoadingPage)
├── utils/          # Client-side utilities
├── test-utils/     # Vitest helpers (TanStack Query result builders, shared QueryClient)
├── styles/         # Global styles and Tailwind config
├── router.tsx      # React Router configuration with route definitions
└── main.tsx        # Application entry point
```

When mocking TanStack Query hooks in specs, use the result builders in
[apps/ui/src/test-utils/queryResults.ts](apps/ui/src/test-utils/queryResults.ts)
(`buildQuerySuccessResult`, `buildQueryLoadingResult`, `buildQueryErrorResult`)
instead of casting partial objects with `as unknown as ReturnType<typeof useFoo>`.
See [apps/ui/src/test-utils/README.md](apps/ui/src/test-utils/README.md).

## Refactoring Guidelines

When modifying existing code, follow these specific refactoring priorities:

### Forms and UI Components

- **React Hook Forms Migration**: Forms that do not use React Hook Form should be refactored to use it, along with their Zod validation schemas and corresponding DTOs from the contracts package. See [PR #1871](https://github.com/Maintainerr/Maintainerr/pull/1871) as a reference example.
- **Form Components**: Use existing form components from `apps/ui/src/components/Forms/` (Input, Select, etc.) and create new ones in this directory if necessary, following the same patterns.
- **Component Naming**: Component file names should follow the exported type name(s) rather than using generic `index.tsx` files. For example, use `UserSettingsForm.tsx` instead of `index.tsx`.

### Server-Side Type Safety

- **Strict Typing Evolution**: Extra care should be taken in the **server** project. While strict type checking is not currently enabled (`strictNullChecks: false`, `noImplicitAny: false`), we are moving toward stricter standards.
- **Type Specifications**: When creating new code, specify explicit types including `undefined` when applicable, rather than relying on computed types.
- **Any Type Elimination**: When encountering `any` types during code changes, attempt to use proper types or create specific type definitions. This includes external API requests and responses.
- **Gradual Migration**: Incrementally improve type safety without breaking existing functionality.
- **Logging**: In injectable server code, prefer `MaintainerrLogger` over raw Nest `Logger`. Set the context once in the constructor. For paired caught-error logs, keep `warn`/`log`/`error` messages plain and put the throwable on `logger.debug(error)`; only use `logger.error('message', error)` when the higher-level log should intentionally carry the throwable.

## External Integrations

The application integrates with several external services:

- **Plex**: Media server API for collections and metadata
- **Jellyfin/Emby**: Media server APIs through the shared media-server abstraction
- **Radarr/Sonarr**: Movie/TV show management APIs
- **Seerr**: Request management system
- **Tautulli**: Plex analytics and statistics
- **Streamystats**: Jellyfin item-level analytics surfaced on media details

When working with these integrations:

- Use proper error handling and retry logic (axios-retry)
- Implement caching where appropriate (node-cache)
- Follow rate limiting best practices
- Use TypeScript interfaces for external API responses

## External API Documentation

Do not add API doc URLs here. Machine-readable OpenAPI specs live in `SPECS` in
[tools/api-spec-drift.mjs](tools/api-spec-drift.mjs), which fetches each one
weekly so the list stays verified. References that have no fetchable spec live in
[implementation.instructions.md](.github/instructions/implementation.instructions.md).

## Testing Guidelines

### Backend Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Jest with @suites for dependency mocking
- **File Pattern**: `*.spec.ts` files alongside source code
- **Coverage**: Focus on service logic and complex business rules
- **Test Database**: Use in-memory SQLite for integration tests

### Frontend Testing

- **Test Runner**: Vitest with React Testing Library
- Keep tests focused on critical user flows

### Local dev mocks & seeding (manual / Playwright testing)

For end-to-end checks of media-server-dependent flows (rules, collections,
overview, calendar, storage) without a real Plex/Jellyfin, the `tools/dev/` folder
has scripts that **complement Playwright** - Playwright drives the UI, these
provide the backend data:

- `tools/dev/fake-jellyfin.mjs` - stateless mock Jellyfin (`:8096`).
- `tools/dev/fake-plex.mjs` - stateless mock Plex (`:32400`); covers the Plex-only
  getter paths (smart collections, watch history, accounts, ratings,
  shows/seasons/episodes) that the Jellyfin mock can't.
- `tools/dev/fake-radarr.mjs` - mock Radarr v3 (`:7878`); covers the
  collection-handler → RadarrActionHandler flow (DELETE / UNMONITOR / "add import
  list exclusion") that the media-server mocks can't. Resolves any `tmdbId` to a
  movie, and replicates Radarr's exclusion semantics: `POST /exclusions/bulk`
  de-dupes (idempotent), singular `POST /exclusions` 400s on a duplicate.
- `tools/dev/seed-db.mjs` - the **only** DB-touching script. Seeds settings,
  collections, and rule groups **with rules** covering ~all rule properties, plus
  notifications, cron, logs, exclusions, and overlays. The "Stale Movies"
  collection is seeded as UNMONITOR + listExclusions with `tmdbId`s set, so it
  exercises the Radarr exclusion path against `fake-radarr.mjs`. Target a server
  with `MEDIA_SERVER=plex|jellyfin` (default `jellyfin`).

Workflow: start the matching mock(s), stop `yarn dev` (SQLite is single-writer),
run the seed, restart `yarn dev`. Inspect a getter's live output with
`POST /api/rules/test {"mediaId","rulegroupId"}`, run a rule with
`POST /api/rules/:id/execute`, or run collection handling with
`POST /api/collections/handle`. Note: after editing server code, **restart
`yarn dev`** - a long-lived dev server can serve stale getter logic. Watchlist
and plex.tv user enrichment can't be mocked locally (they hit plex.tv) and
degrade gracefully.

## Development Notes

### Environment Setup

- **Node.js**: 22.22.2+, 24.15.0+, or 26+ (root `package.json` `engines` is the source of truth; Docker and the devcontainer ship Node 26)
- **Package Manager**: Yarn 4.11 (managed via corepack)
- **Data Directory**: Requires `data/` folder with proper permissions for development

### Key Configuration Files

- `turbo.json`: Turborepo task configuration and caching
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration per package
- `.yarnrc.yml`: Yarn package manager configuration
- Docker support available via `Dockerfile`

### Performance Considerations

- Use Turborepo caching for faster builds
- Leverage Vite's fast HMR and optimized production builds
- Implement proper database indexing in TypeORM entities
- Use React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- Use React.lazy with Suspense for code splitting
- Optimize images and assets appropriately
